How to Read This Tutorial
=========================

This tutorial walks you through the TYPO3 backend module by module. While doing this,
important TYPO3 features are explained and we show you how to do common tasks like
using the TYPO3 clipboard for editing.

This is a hands on tutorial: It is recommended to have a working TYPO3 installation
available and try out the features as you go along. You learn how to setup a TYPO3
installation in :ref:`installation`. In this tutorial we use a TYPO3 installation
based on the Introduction Package. Since TYPO3 is highly configurable, the items in
the GUI may look and behave slightly differently if your installation is not based
on the Introduction Package or has been modified otherwise.

The chapter :ref:`general-principles` gives you a general overview over the main parts
and features of the backend. The following chapters :ref:`list-module` and :ref:`file-module`
show some basic editing tasks using these modules. They are highly recommended for
**editors**.

The following chapters handle some **administration** and **configuration tasks**. They
require additional privileges in the backend. Editors will
usually not have access to system modules. So, for editors it is recommended to skip right to
the section :ref:`next-steps-editors`.

**Integrators** who wish to integrate an existing template into TYPO3 may wish to
start reading with :ref:`Templating`.

All target audiences will find recommendations for additional reading in the :ref:`next-steps`
section.
