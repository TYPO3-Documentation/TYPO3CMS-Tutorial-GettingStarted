About This Document
===================

This document is an introduction to the basic principles of TYPO3 CMS. The
example website used in this introduction will get you started
immediately on your own first TYPO3 CMS website. After this tutorial you
should have an overview about TYPO3 CMS's capabilities, its general structure
and extension possibilities. Professional creation of templates and
development with TYPO3 CMS in general are not covered by this document.


French Translation
------------------

A French translation has been created by Jonathan Iroulin.

We are currently working on optimizing the rendering. Due to this, there
was an issue with rendering the translation. The translated version still
exists in a separate branch **fr** and only needs to be reactivated once
the issues with rendering have been solved and the French branch has been
reviewed for TYPO3 9.
