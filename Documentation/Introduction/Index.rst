About This Tutorial
===================

This tutorial will introduce you to TYPO3's backend, covering each of its modules in detail.
It will also show you to how to carry out common tasks that you would expect to perform
in any content management system.

In the :ref:`installation` chapter, you will learn how to set up TYPO3 after completing a new installation.
We use a TYPO3 installation based on the Introduction Package. Since TYPO3 is highly configurable, the items in
the GUI may look and behave slightly differently if your installation is not using the Introduction Package.

The chapter :ref:`general-principles` gives you an overview of TYPO3's backend. Here you will learn how to
log in to the CMS and perform other tasks such as creating pages in the Page Tree and adding content to individual pages.

The chapters :ref:`list-module` and :ref:`file-module`
cover some basic editing tasks and are aimed at **editors**.

The next few chapters handle some **administration** and **configuration tasks**. They
require enhanced backend privileges. Editors will
usually not have access to these modules.

For editors, we recommended that you proceed
to the :ref:`next-steps-editors` section.

**Integrators** who wish to start adding HTML templates into their installation of TYPO3
can find out more in the :ref:`Templating` section.

All target audiences will find recommendations for additional reading in the :ref:`next-steps`
section.
