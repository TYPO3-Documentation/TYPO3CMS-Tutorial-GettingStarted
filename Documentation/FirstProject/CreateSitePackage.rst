Creating a site package
=======================

The next step is to create a site package. In TYPO3, a site package is a
structured package that organizes the layout, design, and essential
configuration settings for your website. By using a site package, you can
manage all customizations in one place, which keeps your changes organized and
makes your project easier to maintain, even through TYPO3 updates.
