Create a new site configuration
===============================

Before creating a site configuration, you should have created the root page of
your site in the page tree.

..  todo: Link to "How to create a root page", once https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Tutorial-GettingStarted/issues/421
    is resolved.

The site configuration is stored in a file called
:file:`config/sites/my_site/config.yaml`. For your convenience, you can
edit this file using the backend module: :guilabel:`Site Management > Sites`.

Available root pages should be listed in this module. Click
the button :guilabel:`Add new site configuration` next to the relevant
page to create a site configuration for it.

In the next step, you can enter some basic information about the site.

The site identifier can be arbitrary, so we use "example_site" here. The
entry point should be a URL pointing to the web root. In this example, it is
a local URL generated by `DDEV <https://ddev.com/>`__.

In the next two tabs, you can define error handling, such as a custom 404 page,
and static routes, for example, to a :file:`robots.txt` file.

You can read more about :ref:`Site Handling <t3coreapi:sitehandling>` in
the reference "TYPO3 Explained".

After saving, a new file should be created in your project:

.. literalinclude:: _config.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :caption: config/sites/example_site/config.yaml
