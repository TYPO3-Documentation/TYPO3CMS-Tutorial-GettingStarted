How to create a root page
=========================

In TYPO3, the root page is the starting point for any website.
It serves as the top-level page in the page tree and is essential for
configuring the site and making it available to users. In this tutorial,
you will learn how to create a root page in TYPO3 v13.

..  admonition:: Prerequisites

    *   You have TYPO3 :ref:`installed <t3start:installation-ddev-tutorial>`
        and can log into the backend.
    *   You have access to the Page module and permission to create pages.
    *   You are familiar with the basic layout of the TYPO3
        `Backend <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3start:backend>`_.

..  _create-root-page-new-page:

Create a new page on root level
===============================

Once you log into the TYPO3 backend, locate the :guilabel:`Web > Page` module on the left-hand
side of the screen. Click on the Page module to open the page tree.

..  figure:: /Images/ManualScreenshots/CreateRootPage/CreateNewPage.png

*   In the page tree, right-click on the "root level" or the top node of the page
    tree (if no pages exist yet, this will likely be labeled as "site" or similar).
    A context menu will appear.

*   From the context menu, select "New". This will open a form for creating a new
    page.

..  _create-root-page-configure:

Configure the newly created page
================================

Now, you need to configure the new page:

*   In the form that appears, give your new page a name.
    This will be the label of your root page in the page tree.

*   Under the :guilabel:`Behavior` tab, look for the checkbox called
    "Use as Root Page". Ensure this is checked.

..  _create-root-page-save:

Save the page
=============

Once you have filled in the necessary information and selected the
"Use as Root Page" option, click the "Save" button at the top of the
form. Your new root page will now appear in the page tree on the left.
The page is only visible in the Backend at this point

..  figure:: /Images/ManualScreenshots/CreateRootPage/PageCreated.png

    The root page is disabled, therefore it is marked with the red icon.
    You can enable it in the context menu.

..  _create-root-page-site:

Configure the site
==================

All sites must have a `site configuration <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3start:site-management>`_.
If you have created a new page in the root of the page tree, the site configuration has been
created automatically and you can edit it:

..  figure:: /Images/ManualScreenshots/CreateRootPage/AutogeneratedSiteConfig.png
    :alt: The auto-generated site of a new root page viewed in the "Sites" module

    You can find the auto-generated site configuration for your root page in the module :guilabel:`Site Management > Sites`

..  _create-root-page-site-package:

Create a site package for the theme
===================================

The site needs a theme, also known as a "site package" in the TYPO3 world. Learn more about 
`creating a site package <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3start:creating-a-site-package>`_.

..  admonition:: Trouble shooting

    TYPO3 does not come with a default theme. You will have to install
    or create a site package. If your site does not have a theme configured,
    you will see a message like the the one below when trying to display 
    the page in the frontend:

    ..  figure:: /Images/ManualScreenshots/CreateRootPage/NoTypoScriptFound.png
        :alt: Error message: No TypoScript record found!

        Error message when no site package is installed or configured

    *   `How to create a site package <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3start:how-to-create-a-site-package>`_
    *   `Troubleshooting "No TypoScript found!" <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3tsref:guide-troubleshooting>`_
    *   The `Introduction Package <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3start:introductionpackage-index>`_
        includes a ready-to-use theme and example content.

..  _create-root-page-enable:

Enable the page when you are ready
==================================

:guilabel:`Enable` the page as newly created pages are hidden by default.

..  figure:: /Images/ManualScreenshots/CreateRootPage/EnablePage.png
    :alt: A disabled root page and its context menu

    Right click on the newly created page and chose `Enable` from the context menu. The red icon should disappear.
