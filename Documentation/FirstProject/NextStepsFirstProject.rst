The next step is to create a sitepackage. In TYPO3, a sitepackage is a
structured package that organizes the layout, design, and essential
configuration settings for your website. By using a Sitepackage, you can
manage all customizations in one place, which keeps your changes organized and
makes your project easier to maintain, even through TYPO3 updates.

How to create a sitepackage
===========================

To create a sitepackage, you have two main options:

*   Manual creation: For full control over your project's setup, you can follow
    the detailed instructions int the
    :ref:`TYPO3 site package tutorial <t3sitepackage:start>`.

*   Using the `Sitepackage-Builder <https://www.sitepackagebuilder.com/>`__:
    If you're looking for a faster start,
    the Sitepackage-Builder is a handy tool. It builds on the
    `Bootstrap Package <https://www.bootstrap-package.com/>`__
    and provides a pre-configured setup with Bootstrap-based layouts and
    elements, which you can further customize.

Pros and cons of using the Sitepackage-Builder
==============================================

Pros:

*   The Sitepackage-Builder is particularly useful for beginners or projects
    that need a quick start. Since it's built on the Bootstrap framework,
    it includes a wide range of ready-to-use, responsive components that can
    save development time.

Cons:

*   Using a Bootstrap-based package may limit customization flexibility,
    especially if your design requirements don't align with Bootstrap's
    structure. For highly customized or non-Bootstrap designs,
    a manual sitepackage might offer more freedom.
