============================================
Creating and configuring TYPO3 backend users
============================================

Each person that uses the TYPO3 backend should have their own personal backend
user account.

The user that was automatically created for you during
`Installation <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3start:installation-index>`_
has the widest rights possible and is a System Maintainer. The System Maintainer
is an Administrator who can also see and use the section
`Admin Tools <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3start:admin-tools>`_ in the
backend.

..  tip::
    If your Backend User account does not seem to work for some reason, check
    chapter `Troubleshooting common TYPO3 backend login
    problems <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3start:troubleshooting-backend-login>`_.

        Create personal administrator accounts and mange them. Grant
        System Maintainer permissions to administrators.
