The List module
---------------

In TYPO3 CMS all the information is stored in database records:
pages, content elements, templates, users, news items, etc.
For some of this information dedicated modules exist, like
the *Page* or the *Template* module which we visited earlier.

But these records, as well as all others that don't have such
a dedicated module, can be created and edited using the
**WEB > List** module.
