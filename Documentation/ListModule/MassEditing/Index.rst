============
Mass Editing
============

The *List* module also makes it possible to display more information
about each record and to edit several records at a time.
To enable this, first click on the table header (1):

.. figure:: ../../Images/BackendListAdditionalFields.png
   :alt: The List view with an additional field displayed


This restricts the view to that single table and adds a selector (2)
where you can select which additional fields to display. Select the "Type"
field for now and click on the "Set fields" button.
This makes the "Type" field appear in a new column to the right of the record
list (4).


.. _editing-all-headers:

Editing all Headers
===================

To edit the headers of all records in one go,
simply click the little pencil next to the "Header" label:

.. figure:: ../../Images/BackendListEditAllHeaders.png
   :alt: The button to edit a given field for all records

You will then see this:

.. figure:: ../../Images/BackendListChangeAllHeaders.png
   :alt: Editing form displayed for all records

When saving the changed will be stored for all records.

All field that are currently viewable can be edited at the same
time, by choose a different icon:

.. figure:: ../../Images/BackendListEditAllFields.png
   :alt: The button to edit all fields visible in the list

The result is almost the same form, but with the additional field:

.. figure:: ../../Images/BackendListChangeAllFields.png
   :alt: Editing form displayed for all records and all fields

This can be further refined. Activate one of the clipboard pads if
this is not already the case and check the boxes for a couple of records:

.. figure:: ../../Images/BackendListSelectiveEditing.png
   :alt: Selecting records for editing

The result is a form for editing just the chosen field for the
selected records:

.. figure:: ../../Images/BackendListSelectiveEditingForm.png
   :alt: Editig form displayed for the selected records
