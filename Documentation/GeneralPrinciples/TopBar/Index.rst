The Top Bar
===========

The top bar contains some information and additional menus.

To the left is the TYPO3 CMS logo (which can be modified by an extension,
as the Introduction Package does), then comes the name of your site
(this is part of global configuration, which is decribed later).

The star icon will open a list of bookmarked views. Every time
you see such an icon in the TYPO3 CMS backend, you can click on it
and the current view will get saved to this list of bookmarks.

The lightning bolt icon opens the menu to flush the various
caches that are used by TYPO3 CMS to improve performance.
Caches are described in detail in :ref:`Core APIs <t3coreapi:caching>`.

The question mark icon opens the help menu, which gives access
to various modules related to help and documentation.

The next icon opens up a panel showing various information
about the current system and TYPO3 CMS installation.

   :alt: The top bar with the user menu


The user name is displayed next. It opens a menu giving access
to the "User Settings" module, where you can change your password
and various preferences. Here is also the "Logout" button.

Finally, flush right, is a general "Search" field, which will search
through all records (pages, content elements, users, etc.) existing
in the current TYPO3 CMS installation.
