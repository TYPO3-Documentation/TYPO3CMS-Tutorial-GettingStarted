   Backend top bar

#. To the left is the icon for **minimizing the Module Menu**.
#. You already met the next icon on the left. It is for
   :ref:`collapsing the page tree <collapse-page-tree>`.
#. Moving on to the next icon, we have the **TYPO3 CMS logo**
   (which may have been modified by an extension).
   Then comes the **name of your site**. This is part of global
   configuration, which is described later.
#. The star icon will open a list of **Bookmarks**. Every time
   you see this icon in the TYPO3 backend, you can click on it
   and the current view will get saved to this list of bookmarks.
#. The lightning bolt icon opens the **Clear Cache** menu to flush the various
   caches that are used by TYPO3 CMS to improve performance.
   Caches are described in detail in TYPO3 Explained::ref:`t3coreapi:caching`.
#. The question mark icon opens the **Help** menu, which gives
   you access to helper modules and additional support documentation.
#. The next icon opens up a panel showing various information
   about the environment.
#. Your user name is displayed next. It opens a menu giving access
   to the **"User Settings"** module, where you can change your password
   and configure other backend preferences. You can also "Logout" of
   the CMS from this menu option.
#. At the far right, is general **"Search"** field, which will search
   through records (pages, content elements, users, etc.)  that exist
   within your installation of TYPO3.
