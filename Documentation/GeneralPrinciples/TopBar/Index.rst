The top bar
^^^^^^^^^^^

The top bar features a set of menus that allow you to quickly carry out common administrative tasks.

The top bar also contains specific information about your environment including the name of your installation
and also the version of TYPO3 it is currently running.

To the left is the TYPO3 CMS logo (which can be modified customised), 
then comes the name of your site (this is part of global configuration, 
which is described later on).

The star icon will open a list of bookmarked views. Every time
you see this icon in the backend, you can click on it
and the current view will get saved to this list of bookmarks.

The lightning bolt enables you to flush various
caches that are used by CMS.
Caches are described in detail in :ref:`Core APIs <t3api:caching>`.

The question mark icon opens the help menu, which gives you access
to helper modules and additional support documentation.

The next icon opens a panel showing various information
about your environment and your current installation of TYPO3.

Your user name is displayed next. It opens a menu giving access
to the "User Settings" module, where you can change your password
and configure other backend preferences. You can also "Logout" of
the CMS from this menu option.

At the far right, is a general "Search" field, which will search
through all backend records (pages, content elements, users, etc.) that exist
within your installation of TYPO3.
