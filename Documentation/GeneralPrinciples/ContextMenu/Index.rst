The contextual menus
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While learning about the :ref:`page tree <page-tree>`,
you already saw that you could get a contextual menu
when clicking on a page icon.

Contextual menus exist in many places in the TYPO3 CMS
backend. Just try your luck clicking on any icon that
you see. Chances are good that a contextual menu will
appear, offering useful functions to execute.

For example, there's a contextual menu in the **WEB > List** view:

.. figure:: ../../Images/BackendContextMenuListModule.png
   :alt: The contextual menu in the List

or in the **FILE > Filelist** view:

.. figure:: ../../Images/BackendContextMenuFileModule.png
   :alt: The contextual menu in the List
