The contextual menus
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While learning about the :ref:`page tree <page-tree>`,
we were introduced to contextual menus
when selecting icons in the Page module.

Contextual menus exist throught the CMS's
backend. You will notice that different sets of
icons appear depending on what page you are on
what actions you are performing.

For example, there's a contextual menu in the **WEB > List** view:

.. figure:: ../../Images/BackendContextMenuListModule.png
   :alt: The contextual menu in the List

or in the **FILE > Filelist** view:

.. figure:: ../../Images/BackendContextMenuFileModule.png
   :alt: The contextual menu in the List
