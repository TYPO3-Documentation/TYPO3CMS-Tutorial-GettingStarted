=========
Page Tree
=========

The page tree represents the hierarchical structure of your pages. In
most cases this corresponds exactly to the navigation structure
of your web site. The page tree can be expanded by clicking
the little arrows on the left of the items.

For example, click on the arrow next to the page called "About".
Your page tree should look like this:

.. figure:: ../../Images/BackendPageTree.png
   :alt: The page tree with the "About" page expanded


Simultaneously have a look at the navigation in the frontend. Click on
**About** item in the main menu on top and then select **TYPO3** from the sub-menu:

.. figure:: ../../Images/FrontendAboutPage.png
   :alt: Frontend of the Introduction Package


As you see the main menu on top of your web site corresponds to the first
level menu pages in the page tree. The sub-menu of the **About** page
in the frontend corresponds to the entries beneath **About** in the page tree.

The page with the world icon represents the root of your web site.
There may be several web sites per TYPO3 installation.
The top node with the TYPO3 logo is a special container which is used
to store very general information.

Modules may display the page tree or not. The presence of the page tree
implies that the module reacts to the selection of a page in the page tree.

A click on the page title opens that page in the content area on
the right. Hovering over the icon of a page will display its internal id.

A click on the page icon will open the context menu. Alternatively you
can right click the whole page title.

  anymore)

  - Delete: Deletes the page

    treeroot

  - Collapse Branch: Same as clicking on an "open" arrow

  - Export to .t3d: Opens the export tool and preselects the selected page

  - Import from .t3d: Opens the import tool and preselects the selected
    page

It is also possible to view a page directly in the backend, by selecting the View module,
which also offers the possibility to preview a page in different screen sizes, thanks
to the drop-down menu at the top.
