Backend and Frontend
====================

TYPO3 CMS is divided into two areas - the *backend* and the *frontend*.

.. index:: Frontend

Frontend
========

The *frontend* is the website that is produced by TYPO3 CMS.

To display the *frontend*, enter the URL of your web site
in the address bar of your browser (e.g.
`http://www.your-site.example.org/`).


.. index:: Backend
.. _backend-login:

Backend
=======

The administrative area of the web site is called the *backend*.
It is from here you create and manage the content that is viewed
in the *frontend*.

A user name and a password are always required to log into the backend.

1. Enter URL with `/typo3` in your browser

   The *backend* is accessed by adding `/typo3/` to your web site's
   URL (e.g `http://www.your-site.example.org/typo3/`).

   A login page looking like this will be displayed:

2. Login

   Use the user name (default is **admin**) and the password that you defined during
   the installation process.

   After pressing the **login** button you will be redirected to the TYPO3 CMS
   backend overview:

It can be reached using the help menu in the top bar
and selecting :guilabel:`About TYPO3 CMS`.
