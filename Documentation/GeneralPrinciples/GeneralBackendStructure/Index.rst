=========================
General backend structure
=========================

Here is a complete overview of the backend interface and its structure.

Situated in the center left of page is the
*page tree* and to its right the (main) *content area*.

Top bar (top)
   This gives you access to your user settings, logout, search
   etc.

Module menu (left)
   This is the main menu of the TYPO3 CMS backend. It is divided
   into main modules (:guilabel:`WEB`, :guilabel:`FILE`, etc.) and
   their sub-modules.

Page tree (middle)
   This can be used to browse through and select pages.

Content area (right)
   This is where you can edit pages and content elements.

Docheader (top)
   The *docheader* contains contextual icons including close, save and preview.
   It also features other information and a drop-down menu with further actions
   which will appear depending on what actions you are performing.
