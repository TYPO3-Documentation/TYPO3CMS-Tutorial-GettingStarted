General Backend Structure
=========================

Here is a complete overview of the general backend structure.

On top of the *modules menu* and the *top bar* which we saw in
the previous chapter, we now have in the middle
the *page tree* and on the right the (main) *content area*.

The so-called *docheader* contains the action icons - like close, save or preview
- some general information and sometimes a drop-down menu with further actions.

We will have a closer look at the individual parts in the next pages.
