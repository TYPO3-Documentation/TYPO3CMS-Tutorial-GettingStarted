============
Page Content
============

Site content can be structured in many ways.

A good place to start exploring different ways content
can be arranged is the "Content Examples" section.

.. rst-class:: bignums

1. Expand the page "Content Examples"

   In the backend, click on the arrow next to the "Content Examples" title
   to open the subtree.

      :class: with-shadow

2. Next, do the same for the "Text" page, and then click on "Text in Columns"

3. Use the context menu to show the "Text in Columns" page in the frontend.

   Select :guilabel:`"Show"`

Let's now compare both views.

**Frontend:**

   Page content as seen in the frontend


**Backend:**

For now we want to be in "Columns" mode. If that is not the case when you
got to the Page module, please use the menu in the docheader to switch mode.

   Changing the mode to "Columns" mode

The order of the content elements on the web page is the
same as the order of the elements in the backend. The content elements
are stored in columns, content that is in the right
column in the backend is in the right column on your page, etc. Each
content element on your page can be of a different type (like text or
text & images) giving you a lot of flexibility.

   Content elements in the backend

The Page module shows a preview of each content element, together
with some action icons. Here is a quick overview:

   Content element preview and action icons


#. **Insert** a new content element above the current one
#. An **icon** representing the type of content element
   (hovering over it will show its id)
#. **Edit** the content element
#. **Hide/show** the content element
#. **Delete** content element
#. A **preview** of the element's content (will vary depending on the type)
#. **Insert** a new content element below the current one


Modifying existing content or adding new content is covered in the
:ref:`Editors Tutorial <t3editors:content-elements>`.
