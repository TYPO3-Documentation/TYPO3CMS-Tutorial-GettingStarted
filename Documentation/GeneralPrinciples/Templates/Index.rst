After that brief overview of pages and content elements,
you might wonder how all this structure is turned into a
web site, complete with page layout, CSS and JavaScript files.

In TYPO3 CMS this job is achieved using *templates* which should
be considered as a kind of configuration written in a language called
*TypoScript*.

The **WEB > Template** module provides an overview of the
TypoScript configuration and allows to work with so-called
"template records", which is where the TypoScript configuration
is actually stored.

Here is a brief view of the *Template* module:

Templating itself is covered by other tutorials:

- the :doc:`TypoScript in 45 minutes Tutorial <t3ts45:Index>` covers the basics of TypoScript
  and how to relate pages and content elements to an actual HTML output.

- the :doc:`Templating Tutorial <t3templating:Index>` guides you through the actual integration
  of HTML models into your TYPO3 CMS installation using TypoScript.
