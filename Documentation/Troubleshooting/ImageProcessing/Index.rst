A Note on Image Processing
==========================

TYPO3 CMS relies on ImageMagick or GraphicsMagic to generate on the fly
images matching the specified sizes. If you do not see all expected images
it could that neither ImageMagick nor GraphicsMagic are installed on your
server or that your installation is not properly configured.

For more help on the topic, please refer to the
:doc:`Installation Guide <t3install:Index>`.

You could also ask for help in the `installation forums <https://forum.typo3.org/index.php/i/6/>`_.
