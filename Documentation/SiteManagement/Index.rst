Create a new site configuration
===============================

Before you create a site configuration you should have created the root page of
your site in the page tree.

The site configuration is stored in a file called
:file:`config/sites/my_site/config.yaml`. For your convenience you
can edit this file with the backend module
:guilabel:`Site Management > Sites`.

Available root pages should be listed in this module. Click on the
button :guilabel:`Add new site configuration` beside that page to create a
site configuration for it.

    Create a new site configuration

In the next step you can enter some basic information about the site.

The site identifier will can be arbitrary so we use "example_site" here.
The entry point should be an URL pointing to the web root. In our example this
is a URL generated by DDEV.

    Site sets have been added with TYPO3

From the list of available sets choose the set of your site package if you have
one. You can learn to create a site package in the
:ref:`TYPO3 Sitepackage Tutorial <t3sitepackage:start>`.

    Enter the basic data and choose the site set

As our set already depends on the set of fluid_styled_content it is not
necessary to chose that set here.

    Create a language for your site by choosing it from the list of presets

In the next two tabs you can define error handling like a custom 404 and static
routes, for example to a :file:`robots.txt`. We do not cover these topics here.

Here you can read about :ref:`Site handling <t3coreapi:sitehandling>` in general.

After saving a new file should have been created in your project:

..  literalinclude:: _config.yaml
    :language: yaml
    :caption: config/sites/example_site/config.yaml
