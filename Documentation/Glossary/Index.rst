**Apache**: `Apache httpd <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server>`__ is one
of the options you can choose as a web server. Others are Nginx, Microsoft IIS and Caddy Server (`see system requirements <https://get.typo3.org/version/13#system-requirements>`__).

**Admin Tools**: Admin tools are a group of backend modules.
These include maintaining the installation, adjusting settings, executing upgrade wizards,
checking environment information and setting up extensions.

**Assets**: Assets are media resources such as images, videos and documents that are uploaded and managed in the TYPO3 system.
Also, extensions can include assets which can be referred to in the frontend, like specific icons or JavaScript libraries.

**Application context**: In TYPO3, Application Context specifies the environment
(e.g., Development, Production) the site is running in, adjusting settings like debugging or
performance optimization accordingly. This helps tailor TYPO3 behavior for each stage of deployment.

**Block syntax**: In TypoScript

**Bootstrap**:

**Cache**: Caches are used to improve website performance by storing frequently
accessed data. TYPO3 has multiple caches for various performance relevant areas in both for the frontend and backend.

**CType**: CType refers to Content Type and is a database column field in a very
important database table called "tt_content", where all the content elements are stored.
This column defines the name of the specific content element, and influences how it is displayed in the backend and frontend.
