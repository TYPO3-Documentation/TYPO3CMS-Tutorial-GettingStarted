Template & backend configuration disclaimer!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since the "template" is the crucial point of your implementation
possibilities it is very important to stress that  *this tutorial*
does  *not* to any degree display the depth of possibilities with
templates in TYPO3.


Facts about templates and possibilities
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Just to nail it to your mind for sure, this are some facts about
templates in TYPO3:

- You can implement  *any* design you like, the way you like.

- You can have any number of menu levels.

- You can have multiple sites, multiple templates.

- You can have pages in any number of languages.

- You can have multiple content areas (columns) on a page.

- You can integrate all kinds of external data sources through PHP
  written plugins.

- You can add any number of web applications to run on various pages in
  TYPO3.

- You can extend everything with PHP (with full backwards
  compatibility!).

- You can do anything - some things are just more straightforward (most
  typical things), other things are more tricky (less typical things).
