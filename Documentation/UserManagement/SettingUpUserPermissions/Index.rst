Setting up user permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now we want to know how the users "simple\_editor", "news\_editor" and
"advanced\_editor" have been set up! Log in as "admin" again and let's
explore it. Select "Edit" for the three users. You will see, that they
are almost identical. But they all have a different Group selected.

On the tab "Mounts and Workspaces" there are both " **Mount from
groups:** " are set. Which page and which folder the user can access,
depends on the rights which are set at the group level.

It is a good practice to manage the permissions on group basis.
