Backend User Management
=======================

.. important::

   This chapter (and the following) cover modules that will only be available for backend users
   with :ref:`"admin" <admin-user>` access privileges.

We saw earlier that TYPO3 CMS enforces a strict separation of
so-called "frontend" and "backend". The same is true for users:
there are "frontend users", who are web site visitors, and
"backend users", who are editors and administrators.

Working with frontend users is discussed in the :ref:`Editors Guide <t3editors:frontend-login>`.
We will now look at backend users and how to set up groups and
permissions.
