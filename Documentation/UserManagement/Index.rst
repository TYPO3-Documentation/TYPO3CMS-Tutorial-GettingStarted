User Management
---------------

We saw earlier that TYPO3 CMS enforces a strict separation of
so-called "frontend" and "backend". The same is true for users:
there are "frontend users", who are web site visitors, and
"backend users", who are editors and administrators.

Working with frontend users is discussed in the Editors Guide.
We will now look at backend users and how to set up groups and
permissions.
