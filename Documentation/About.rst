About This Tutorial
===================

This document was created to introduce new users to TYPO3, its core features and
provide an overview on how to configure and administer the CMS.

Upon completing this tutorial, you should have a better understanding about how
the CMS is installed, how the backend is administered and how you begin creating
templates.

French Translation
==================

A French translation has been created by Jonathan Iroulin.

We are currently working on optimizing the rendering. Due to this, there
was an issue with rendering the translation. The translated version still
exists in a separate branch **fr** and only needs to be reactivated once
the issues with rendering have been solved and the French branch has been
reviewed for TYPO3 9.

This manual was originally written by Kasper Skårhøj and adapted to
TYPO3 CMS 4.5 LTS by Philipp Gampe, Martin Holtz, Susanne Moog and François Suter.
It was revised and updated to version 6.2 LTS by Guido Haase, to version 7 LTS
by Francois Suter and to version 9.5 LTS by Sybille Peters.
Tom Warwick made several language improvements for better readability and rewrote
the section on :ref:`Templating`.

Since TYPO3 documentation can now be edited by the TYPO3 community collaboratively,
a number of other people have made changes and improved this tutorial. You can see
