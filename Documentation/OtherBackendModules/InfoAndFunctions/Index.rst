Info and Functions Modules
==========================

The **WEB > Info** module displays a variety of information
related to the pages in your web site. It contains several
functions which can be accessed by the dropdown menu in the
docheader. For example, the *Localization Overview* lets
you check quickly which pages are translated and which are
not. In most Info screens you can change how deep down the
page tree information should be displayed.

The **WEB > Functions** module also offers several features.
The most interesting one is the ability to create several
pages in one go.
