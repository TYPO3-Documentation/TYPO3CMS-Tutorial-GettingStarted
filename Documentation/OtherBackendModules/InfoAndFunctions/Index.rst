===========

The **WEB > Info** module displays a variety of information
related to the pages in your web site. It contains several
functions which can be accessed from the dropdown menu in the
docheader. For example, the *Localization Overview* lets
you quickly identify which pages are translated and which are
not. You can also so set how many levels down the page tree you
wish to analyze.
