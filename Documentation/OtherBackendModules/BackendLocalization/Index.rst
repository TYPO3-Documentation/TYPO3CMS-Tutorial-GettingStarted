========================
Manage backend languages
========================

.. important::

   This chapters cover modules that will only be available for backend users
   with :ref:`"system maintainer" <system-maintainer>` access privileges.

The TYPO3 CMS backend is available in many languages. These
translations are bundled into packages which need to be fetched
from the community translation server (https://translation.typo3.org/).
Once installed backend users can choose which language to use.

   :class: with-shadow

The backend should update itself automatically
but you may want to reload the page in the browser.
Your backend should now be in you selected language.

If a translation is incomplete, the backend will fall
back to English.


Set a default language when creating a backend user
===================================================

A default language can also be set when creating a new backend
user.

.. include:: /Includes/Images/BackendUser/RstIncludes/BeUserDefaultLanguage.rst.txt

.. caution::

   Changing a user's default language will not change the backend
   language if that user has already logged in at least once, as
   the language is kept in the user preferences. Such users will
   need to update their language themselves.
