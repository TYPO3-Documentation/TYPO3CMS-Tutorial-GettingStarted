Installing TYPO3 with DDEV
==========================

This is a step-by-step guide detailing how to install TYPO3 using DDEV, Docker and Composer.

DDEV is used for local development only.

The scripts used in this guide will install TYPO3 v13.1 which is the latest release of the CMS. If you wish to
install the long term support (LTS) release of TYPO3, visit the :ref:`TYPO3 v12
Installation instructions <t3start12:install>`.

Pre-Installation Checklist
--------------------------

#.  **Install Docker** - Visit `docker.com <https://www.docker.com/>`__ to download and install the recommended version of Docker for your operating system.

#.  **Install DDEV** - Follow the `DDEV installation guide <https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__ to install DDEV.

DDEV and Docker need to be installed on your local machine before TYPO3 can be installed. If you need help installing DDEV, support can be found on the `DDEV Discord server <https://discord.gg/kDvSFBSZfs>`__.

Create the Installation Directory
---------------------------------

Create an empty directory to install TYPO3 in and then change into that directory:

..  code-block:: bash

    mkdir t3example
    cd t3example

Create a new DDEV Project
-------------------------

The `ddev config` command will prompt for information about your project. TYPO3 is in the list
of preconfigured projects.

..  code-block:: bash

    ddev config

    # Give the following answers when prompted:

    Project name (t3example):

    Docroot Location (current directory): public

    Project Type [php, typo3, ...] (php): typo3

Docroot Location
    Is the folder containing files that have to be reached by
    the webserver. It contains the vital entry point :file:`index.php`. The folder is commonly called :file:`public`.

Project Type
    Should always be "typo3"

..  note::
    The PHP version (:yaml:`php_version`) should be set manually to the required
    version in :file:`.ddev/config.yaml`.

Alternatively you can skip the prompt by supplying all of the required parameters in a single command:

..  code-block:: bash

    ddev config  --project-type=typo3 --docroot=public --php-version 8.2

Start the project
-----------------

..  code-block:: bash

    ddev start

The webserver is now running but TYPO3 is not yet installed.

Install TYPO3
-------------

..  code-block:: bash

    ddev composer create "typo3/cms-base-distribution:^13"

You now have a **Composer-based TYPO3 installation**.

Run the Installation Setup Tool
-------------------------------

Setup TYPO3 in the console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

..  versionadded:: 12.1
    Starting with TYPO3 12.1 a new CLI command `setup` is introduced as
    an alternative to the existing GUI-based web installer.

Interactive / guided setup (questions/answers):

..  code-block:: bash

    ddev typo3 setup

When prompted give the following answers to work with the default DDEV configuration:

..  code-block:: bash

    Which web server is used?
    > apache

    Database driver?
    > mysqli

    Enter the database "username" [default: db] ? db

    Enter the database "password" ? db

    Enter the database "port" [default: 3306] ? 3306

    Enter the database "host" [default: db] ? db

    Select which database to use:
    > db

Setup TYPO3 with the 1,2,3 Install Tool in the browser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a file called :file:`FIRST_INSTALL` in your webroot

..  code-block:: bash

    ddev exec touch public/FIRST_INSTALL

Open the installer

..  code-block:: bash

    ddev launch /typo3/install.php

Go to the TYPO3 backend:

..  code-block:: bash

    ddev launch /typo3

And login with the credentials you just provided.


Managing the Database
---------------------

:bash:`ddev start` automatically created a database for
you. DDEV also created the file :file:`config/system/additional.php`
in which it configured the database credentials for you.

Many database browsers, including phpMyAdmin, are available to let you browse the database, see `Database GUIs <https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/usage/database-management/#database-guis/>__`

Sending E-Mail
--------------

DDEV creates configuration in :file:`config/system/additional.php`
to capture sent mails. You can see what mails have been sent here:

..  code-block:: bash

    ddev launch -m

Stopping a DDEV Instance
------------------------

If you want to stop all projects from running you can call:

..  code-block:: bash

    ddev poweroff

The projects will stay configured and databases will be persisted.

Deleting a DDEV Instance
------------------------

If you want to delete the project you just created you can remove it by
calling the following command in your new projects root folder:

..  code-block:: bash

     ddev delete --omit-snapshot

This will remove all containers from the project and delete the database.

Afterwards you can safely delete the project's root folder.

DDEV Documentation
------------------

You will want to visit `DDEV's documentation <https://ddev.readthedocs.io/>__`, which also has a `TYPO3 Quick Start <https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/quickstart/#typo3/>__` which parallels this one.
