Prerequisite
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To begin installing TYPO3, you will need access to a web server and
a database that meets the `minimum system requirements
<http://typo3.org/typo3-cms/overview/requirements/>`_.

If you do not have access to a web server and are running Microsoft Windows
locally, you might want to try the `TYPO3Winstaller
<http://typo3winstaller.sourceforge.net/>`_, which will install a web
server and TYPO3 CMS on your computer.
