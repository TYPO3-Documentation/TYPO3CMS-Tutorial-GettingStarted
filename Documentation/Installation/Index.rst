            Every release of TYPO3 is electronically signed by the TYPO3 release team.
            In addition, every TYPO3 package also contains a unique file hash that
            can be used to ensure file integrity when downloading the release. This guide
            details how these signatures can be checked and how file hashes can be compared.
