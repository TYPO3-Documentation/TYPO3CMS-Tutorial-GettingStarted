============
Installation
============

These are the steps you must perform:

#. Make sure your system is setup as described in :ref:`t3install:system-requirements`.
#. Install base system: It is recommended to use Composer for installing as described in
   :ref:`t3install:install-via-composer`. As an alternative, you can install
   TYPO3 without Composer: :ref:`t3install:get-and-unpack-the-typo3-package`.
#. After the base installation, you must follow the steps in :ref:`t3install:the-install-tool`.
#. :ref:`Install the Introduction Package <t3install:introduction-package>`.
   During installation, the Introduction Package will create several example pages and
   content, it will configure the web site and add a website template using the Bootstrap
   Package.

The rest of this tutorial is based on the Introduction Package.
