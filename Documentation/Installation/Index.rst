Installation
============

These are the steps you must perform:

#. Make sure your system is setup as described in `in System Requirements <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/guide-installation/10.4/en-us/In-depth/SystemRequirements/Index.html#system-requirements>`_.
#. Install base system: It is recommended to use Composer for installing as described in
   `Installing TYPO3 via Composer <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/guide-installation/10.4/en-us/QuickInstall/Composer/Index.html>`_.
   As an alternative, you can install
   TYPO3 `without using Composer <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/guide-installation/10.4/en-us/QuickInstall/GetAndUnpack/Index.html>`_.
#. After the base installation, you must follow these steps to `complete the installation <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/guide-installation/10.4/en-us/QuickInstall/TheInstallTool/Index.html>`_.
#. `Install the Introduction Package <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/guide-installation/10.4/en-us/QuickInstall/IntroductionPackage/Index.html>`_.
   During installation, the Introduction Package will create several example pages and
   content, it will configure the web site and add a website template using the Bootstrap
   Package.

The rest of this tutorial is based on the Introduction Package.
