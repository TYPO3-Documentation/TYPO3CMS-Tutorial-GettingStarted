Next steps and further reading
==============================

All of TYPO3's documentation is available 
`docs.typo3.org <https://docs.typo3.org/>`_.
The documentation is divided into the following sections:

#. `Tutorials and Guides <https://docs.typo3.org/Home/GuidesAndTutorials.html>`_
   section covers documents which provide step-by-step
   introductions to specific topics.
#. The `Core Documentation <https://docs.typo3.org/Home/References.html>`_
   is related to the core of TYPO3 CMS and covers the architecture and API in detail.
   Also listed are extensive references (hence their name) about configurations and APIs.
#. The `Extensions <https://docs.typo3.org/Home/Extensions.html>`_ section gathers all
   manuals related to core and public extensions.

This can be quite overwhelming for people new to the CMS and you may feel lost
and unsure about where start. We recommend the following documents for further reading
after this tutorial:

   for your specific task.
