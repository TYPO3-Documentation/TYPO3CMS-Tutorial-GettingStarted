TYPO3 CMS has a lot of documentation available on the
`documentation web site <https://docs.typo3.org/>`_.
The documentation is divided into several sections:

#. `Tutorials and Guides <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/Tutorials.html>`_
   section covers documents which provide step-by-step
   introductions to specific topics.
#. The `Core Documentation <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/References.html>`_
   is related to the core of TYPO3 CMS and covers the architecture and API in detail.
   Also listed are extensive references (hence their name) about configurations and APIs.
#. The `Extensions <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/>`_ gathers all
   manuals related to core and public extensions.

This is admittedly a huge mass of documentation and you may feel lost
about where to look next. We recommend the following documents for further studies
after this tutorial:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 5
   :titlesonly:
   :glob:

   Editors/Index
   Administrators/Index
   Developers/Index
   References/Index


If not stated otherwise, we link to the latest versions of the manuals here, which reflect the latest
TYPO3 version (see https://get.typo3.org/ for a list of releases).

Use the `Version Selector <https://docs.typo3.org/Tips/UsingThisSite/Index.html#version-selector>`__
in the manual, to select the correct version.

   And last but not least: Ask on :ref:`Slack <get-help>` for the best resources
   for your specific task.
