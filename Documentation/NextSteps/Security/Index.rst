=====================
Keep security in mind
=====================

Security is taken very seriously by the developers of TYPO3 CMS. The
`TYPO3 Security Team <http://typo3.org/teams/security/>`_ manages possible security
incidents. They review them and consider their impact. Security advisories
are regularly published.

More information about security can be found in the
:ref:`t3coreapi:security`.
