For a more detailed description of TSconfig, TCA and TypoScript reference, please see the
:ref:`t3coreapi:start`.

TSconfig reference
   :ref:`TSconfig Reference <t3tsconfig:start>` covers both
   *Page TSconfig* and *User TSconfig*, with which you are able to change the behavior of
   the **backend** in parts. You can change labels, hide or show fields, set
   permissions and default values. This reference explains which options are available in
   TYPO3 CMS.

TypoScript reference
   The :ref:`TypoScript Reference <t3tsref:start>` describes the different functions
   and objects which can be used to configure the **frontend** output, including the
   full page template and the rendering of individual content elements according to
   their type.

Fluid ViewHelper reference
   The :ref:`t3viewhelper:start` is useful when you work with the Fluid templating
   engine.

TCA reference
   The :ref:`t3tca:start` is only relevant for developers. It describes the global
   array called $GLOBALS['TCA']. This array is a layer on top of the database
   tables that TYPO3 can operate on. It is a very central element of the TYPO3 architecture.
