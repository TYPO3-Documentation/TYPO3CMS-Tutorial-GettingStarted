Extensions are pieces of software developed by the TYPO3 community that extend
the functionality of a TYPO3 installation. Extensions come in many forms
- from small extensions that carry out specific tasks to larger extensions that
provide an entire suite of functionality, e.g. the TYPO3 Blog Extension.
