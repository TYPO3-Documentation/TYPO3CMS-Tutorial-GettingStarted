The context menus
=================

While learning about the :ref:`page tree <page-tree>`,
we were introduced to contextual menus
when selecting icons in the :guilabel:`Content > Layout` module.

Contextual menus exist throughout the CMS's
backend. You will notice that different sets of
icons appear depending on what page you are on
what actions you are performing.

For example, there is a contextual menu in the :guilabel:`Content > Records` view:

.. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/RecordsModule/ContextMenu.rst.txt

or in the :guilabel:`Media` view:

.. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/FilelistModule/ContextMenu.rst.txt
