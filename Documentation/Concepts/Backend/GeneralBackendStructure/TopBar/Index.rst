including the name of your site and also the version of TYPO3 it is currently running.

#. To the left is the icon for **minimizing the Module Menu**.
#. Next comes the **TYPO3 CMS logo**
   (which may have been modified by an extension).
   Then comes the **name of your site**. This is part of global
   configuration, which is described later.
#. The star icon will open a list of **Bookmarks**. You can add one on most pages
   in the backend by clicking the share icon in the DocHeader and selecting "Create
   a bookmark to this record" in the dropdown.
#. The lightning bolt icon opens the **Clear Cache** menu to flush the various
   caches that are used by TYPO3 CMS to improve performance.
   Caches are described in detail in TYPO3 Explained::ref:`t3coreapi:caching`.
#. The document icon displays your **Open and Recently Used Documents**
#. The question mark icon opens the **Help** menu, which gives
   you access to helper modules and additional support documentation.
#. The next icon opens up a panel showing various information
   about the environment.
#. Your user name is displayed next. It opens a menu giving access
   to the **"User Settings"** module, where you can change your password
   and configure other backend preferences. You can also "Logout" of
   the CMS from this menu option.
#. The general **"Search"** field is at the top of the page tree. Here you can search
   through all the records (pages, content elements, users, etc.) in your TYPO3
   installation. Search using characters or numbers (uids).
