=============
Backend login
=============

The backend is accessed via the url (insert your domain) :samp:`example.org/typo3`.

.. figure:: /Images/Illustrations/backend_login.png

When a user logs into the backend they see the dashboard (by default).

..  note::
    Since TYPO3 v13, a custom entry point for the TYPO3 backend can be
    customized. If the path :samp:`/typo3` does not work, consult the
    project's documentation or ask your administrator for the correct backend
    URL.
