Extensions (System)
===================

..  versionchanged:: 14.0
    This module has been moved from :guilabel:`Admin tools` to :guilabel:`System`
	see `Feature: #107628 - Improved backend module naming and structure <https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/changelog:feature-107628-1729026000>`_.

Only available if :composer:`typo3/cms-extensionmanager` is installed.

The backend module :guilabel:`System > Extensions`, also called
"Extension Manager", can be used in Composer-based extensions to view which
TYPO3 extensions are installed. In Classic mode installation (not in the scope
of this guide) they can also be used to install and activate extensions:
:ref:`Installing an Extension using the Extension Manager <t3coreapi:extension-install>`.
